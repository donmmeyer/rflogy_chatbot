for transmitting these waves from one point to another with minimal loss. Waveguides are commonly used in applications such as radar, satellite communications, and 
microwave ovens.

Key Functions of a Waveguide:

What are Phase shifters:
Phase shifters are electronic devices used to adjust the phase angle of an electromagnetic signal without altering its amplitude or frequency. They are commonly used in radio frequency (RF) and microwave applications, including communication systems, radar systems, and phased array antennas. Here's what they do and where they are applied:

What Phase Shifters Do:
Phase Adjustment:

Phase shifters modify the phase of a signal by delaying or advancing its waveform. The amount of phase shift is typically adjustable and can be controlled electronically, mechanically, or digitally.
Signal Steering:
-In phased array antennas, phase shifters are used to steer the direction of the beam by adjusting the phase of the signal at each antenna element. This allows for electronic beam steering without moving the antenna physically.
-Interference Control:
-They help in mitigating interference and improving signal clarity by adjusting the phase relationship between signals in communication systems.
Matching Signals:Phase shifters are used to align the phase of signals in systems where multiple signals need to combine coherently, such as in radar systems and amplifiers.

Applications of Phase Shifters:
Phased Array Antennas: Phase shifters play a crucial role in controlling the direction and shape of the beam, enabling adaptive beamforming for better target tracking and communication.
Radar Systems: Used to control the direction of radar beams for surveillance and tracking applications.
